# Hide ULX & ULib Commands

This addon will hide all commands that has been registered with ULib (and ULX)  
Works with commands added by custom ULX or ULib extensions  
Won't interfere with non-command messages prefixed with !  

It doesn't affect ULX's Fancy Log system (eg. You granted god mode upon Yourself)  
You can already disable that by executing ulx_logecho 0
